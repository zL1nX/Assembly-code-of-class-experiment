# Assembly-code-of-class-experiment

- some assembly codes for my class experiment
- it had to take me two days to learn about some basic concepts and instructions.
- Thus, they may be shitty but should be original.
- Accordingly, the whole experimental guidebook has also been uploaded where you can see the requirements for each piece of code.
- Environments required: 
  + Windows
  + Emu8086
